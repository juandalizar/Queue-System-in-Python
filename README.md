Have you ever had to wait in a long queue in banks or stores to transfer money or open new account, withdraw money from customer service or ATM, purchase your favorite products, respectively? often should worry about the long queues just to perform simple transaction. I'm sure you might have experienced the same at some point in your life.

Today, the development of science has enabled next-level customer service to finance companies, banks, stores etc through system queue preferably to avoid long queues in store or office. this improvement that company must be doing to make their customer happy.

Python as the one of popular program at this moment could accomodate Customer Queue preferably. I take my projection during my bootcamp datascience for building simply customer queue in a bank using python.

Let's say we have user from banking company then given us the job to develop a simply program to manage the customers queue in a Bank.

The program should be able to divides the right amount of queue length for each bank teller, so that there is no one teller that get a longer queue than other tellers, and also customer know their purpose teller (their teller name are Angel, Mellysa, David, Thom, and Monica).

the program should be also so wanted to know names of the first and the last customer who queued since the user need to know.

the program will view as below picture where a queue view more tidy on each teller.

Code available here in the colab notebook separately. the code run and will be as below video

Thank you for reading. As a beginner in python, i recognize my code probably is not the best effective code to develop customer queue. so please feel free giving me best suggestion in order getting me more colorful in python.
